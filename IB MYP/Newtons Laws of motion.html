            <h1>Newton's Laws Of Motion</h1>
            <h2>Newton's first law of motion:</h2>
            â€‹<p>The meaning of inertia in Oxford dictionary is " a tendency to do nothing or 
                to remain unchanged". The law of inertia talks about the tendency of bodies to do nothing to
                 change their present state. It means whatever the body is doing at present, in absence of 
                 all the external forces,  will continue to do the same forever. Law of inertia is universal
                  and applicable to all the bodies. It is applicable on us also. ILet's take an example, if
                   we are playing, we want to play forever until and unless we don't get tired or someone
                    calls us to do other work. Hunger, thirst, responsibility force use to stop doing what
                     we may be doing. Someone calling us to do the work is applying an external force in the 
                     form of order or request or reminding us of our duty.  The law of inertia says that all
                      the bodies try to remain in their initial state until and unless an external force acts
                       on them. it can be stated as follows: if a body is addressed it will be rest and if a
                        body is in motion it will be in motion until an external force acts on it.



               <strong>For example:</strong> 
                
                The book kept on the table be a stay on the table.
                
                Glass kept in the kitchen will always stay in the kitchen until an unless someone comes and disturbs their position.
                
                If a car is moving in absence of friction then it will continue to move unless some external force 
                acts in opposite direction of it's motion</p>

               <h2>Newton's Second Law of Motion</h2>
                <p>According to Newton's second law, "the rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the applied and balance force."

                    For example:
                    
                    when a cricketer catches the ball, to increase the impact time he pulls his hand backward. This decreases the force applied by the ball on his hands.
                    
                    To make the landing smooth we jump on the cushion.
                </p>

                <h2>Newton's Third Law of Motion</h2>
                <P>According to Newton's third law, " for every action there is always equal and opposite reaction."

                    For example:
                    
                    If a person hit the wall,  the wall also applies the reaction force and person gets furt.
                    
                    To move forward we apply  backward force on the earth in turn earth also  applies creation
                     force and we move forward. If we try to move on the sand then it's not easy to move on sand
                      because our legs go down into the sand and the reaction force applied by the sand is smaller.
                    
                    So when the action is less reaction will be less and when action is greater reaction will 
                    also be greater.  These are very much laws of nature.

                <h3>Distance and Displacement Questions</h3>
                <h4>  Question1: Two forces of 5 Kg from left and 20 kg from right are acting on  an stationary 
                    object. Calculte the net force on the object.</h4>

               <p> Answer:   As given in the question, two forces are oppsite to each other.
                If 5N is positive the 20N would be negaitve. 
                
                Fnet  = 5 - 20  = - 15 N.
                
                Here negative sign shows that 15N force is opposite to 5N force.</p>
            
                <h4>The engine of car supplies force of 300N in forward direction on the car and
                     friction between the typre and road acts 50N in backward direction. Calculate the
                      net force on car.</h4>
                
                <p> given in the question, two forces, friction and force by engine, are oppsite to each other.
                If 300N is positive the 50N would be negaitve. 
                
                F<sub>net</sub>  = 300 - 50  = 250 N.
                
                In this example no negative sign, it means net force is in direction of 300N force. </p>
                
                
               <h4> 3. Two forces of 15N  and 20N from right are acting on  an stationary object.
                    Calculte the net force on the object.</h4>
                
               <p> Answer:   As given in the question, two forces are acting in same direction.
                Both 15N and 20N are positive. 
                
                Fnet  = 15 + 20  = 35 N.</p>
