            <h1>Phase Change of Matter</h1>
            <h2>What is Motion? or How to explain motion?</h2>
            ​<p>Water is found in three forms. Solid, liquid and gas.  It changes its state when heat is supplied or removed from it.  </p>

                <h2>Specific Heat Capacity </h2>
                <P>

                    In sun light temperature of sand increases faster compared to water. We can do this experiment at our home to check which one heats up faster. Take same mass of water and sand. Keep it on stove and check the chnage in temperature of both with help of thermometer.
                    
                    You will notice that sand becomes warm faster. This shows that water abosrbs more heat to change its temperature compared to sand. If we take 1kg of water and sand , and measure the change in temperature by 1 degree celsius then we will be able to calculte their specific heat. 
                    
                    Specific heat capacity is defined as the amount of heat required to change the temperature of 1 kg of mass by 1C. 
                    </P>

                    <h2>What is Latent Heat?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The phase change graph above shows that when ice is melting its temperature remains same though heat is supplied continuously. Similar observation is seen when water start boiling and converts into heat. So you may ask a question where is the heat energy supplied to system is going? Its answe can be found in terms of molecular explanation of matter. Incase of solids the molecules are tightly packed. Their potential energy between the molecules is much higher compared to kinetic energy. When solid is heated, its molecules starts vibrating faster increasing  its temprature. At melting point there is no change in temperature, the energy supplied to matter is utilised to break the molecular bonds in to convert it into liquid.

                    <p>
                    PhysicsPros is an online physics learning platform. It is dedicated to creating high-quality physics lessons for International Baccalaureate (IB) Physics , IGCSE Physics. The lessons designed by us are short, easy to comprehend and coupled with right examples. All the example used for explanation are relevant to today's world with high quality images and graphic. Examples which are around us and seen in today's world help students to understand the idea quickly and easily. Since the core concept of Physics remains same, you learn any boards physics all over the world at PhysicPros, because we create quality physics not quantity physics. For practice questions are given at the end of the page. You can learn the concepts and practice the questions given with it. There are worksheets available for practicing offline. Download the the worksheets related to chapter take printout and practice at your own pace. If you get any doubt post it in comments section to get the quick reply form large community of learners.
