            <h1>Spherical Mirrors</h1>
            <h2>What are spherical mirrors?- Types of lens</h2>
            ​<p>What are spherical mirrors?

                As  the name suggest, spherical mirrors are part of imaginary sphere as  show in video below. to form a spherical mirror, part of sphere is  removed and polished with shinning paint, such as silver, from one side.  When the outer part of sphere is polished, it forms a concave mirror.  When inner part of sphere is polished it forms convex mirror. As  spherical mirrors are part of sphere, they have centre of curvature. The  centre of curvature of mirrors is part of imaginary sphere out of which  mirror is formed.
                There are two types of spherical mirrors
                Concave mirror
                Convex Mirror</p>

                <h2>Principal axis of concave and convex mirrors:</h2>
<p>
Principal axis of  spherical mirrors  is the imaginary straight  line which passes from  centre of curvature and the pole of the mirrors. Principal axis in  infinitely long line and  extends both sides of the mirror. It helps us  in calculation and to draw the image of an object formed by the  mirrors.  The green line in above diagrams represents principal axis.
</p>
Pole of concave and convex mirrors:
<p>
Pole is the geometric centre of the spherical mirrors. Principal axis passes form the pole. It is denoted by 'p'.
</p>
Centre of curvature:
<p>
Center of curvature is the  center of sphere from which Spherical mirrors are made. A line passing  from the centre of curvature is always at 90 degree from the surface of  spherical mirror. It is denoted by 'C'.
</p>
Radius of curvature:
<p>
Distance between Center of curvature and the pole of spherical mirrors is called as the radius of curvature. It is denoted by R.
