           <h1>What is momentum?</h1>
<p>
When a body or a particle is in motion it possesses momentum. To know the momenutm of a body we should know it's mass and velocity at that point. Momentum is the product of  mass  and  velocity of object.
 
P = mass x Velocity

p= m x v

We can say that

Momentum is directly proportional to mass and
momentum is directly proportional to velocity.

Unit of momentum is Kgm/s


so let's say if an object of mass 20 kg is moving with the speed of 5 metre per second calculate its moment.

Answer:  
p= m x v
p= 20 x 5 = 100 kgm/s

</p>
<h2> Law of Conservation of Momentum </h2>
<p>
Baseball, cricket, tenis,hockey,etc. conservation of momentum plays important role. When a cricketer hits a ball coming toward him with a heavy bat it goes to long distance. You will notice that the speed of bat is less than the speed of ball after collision. How the ball gains high speed after collision with slow moving bat? The answer can found using conservation of momentum. We know momentum is product of mass and velocity. The bat is many times heavier than the ball. A heavy object moving with small velocity posses higher momentum compared to a lighter body moving with same velocity. When slow moving heavy bat hits the ball, it transfers its mometum to the ball. To conserve the momentum ball moves with high velocity. In this situation we can observe that over all momentum is conserved, it transfers between bat and ball. Same thing happens in tenis, momentum between tenis racquet and ball. hockey stick and ball. You can find many examples of transfer of momentun in your surrounding. If you found one share with with us.

The law of conservation of momentum states that the initial and final momentum of an isolated system is always conserved." An isolated system is separate from all other influences.
It means "the sum of initial momentum of a system is equal to the sum of final momentum of the system". 
The equation of conservation of momentum is given in the image below.
</p>
<p>
Consider two balls of mass m1 and m2  (m1> m2) are rolling on  a smooth surface with velocity  v1 and v2 respectively (u1 >u2) in a straight line as show below. After some time ball of mass m1 hits the ball of mass m2. The collision lasts for very small time and two balls exchange momentum. After collision ball of mass m1 moves with velocity v1 and ball of mass m2 moves with velocity v2. 

The sum of initial momemtum of system can be written as

m1u1+m2u2

The sum of final momemtum of system can be written as
m1v1+m2v2

Apply law of conservation of momentum in this case:

m1u1+m2u2 = m1v1+m2v2
</p>
<p>Example of transfer of momentum: When two players collide wth each other they lose their momentum.</p>
<p>Example of transfer of momentum: A cricket layer  hitting the ball is seen in the image.</p>
<p>Example of transfer of momentum: A baseball player hits the ball with bat.</p>
