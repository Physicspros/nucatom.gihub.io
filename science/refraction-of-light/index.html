            <h1>REFRACTION OF LIGHT</h1>
            <h2>What is refraction of light?</h2>
            ​<p>What is refraction of light?
                Light  is a form of electromagnetic wave. It travels in a straight line until  encounters an obstacle  or there is a change in medium. When a ray of  light enter from one medium to another medium, it deviates from it's  path. The change in path of light due to change in medium is called as  refraction.
                
                The image below shows the refraction of light. When a ray of light traveling in medium 'A', here the medium is air, enter in medium 'B' , second medium is glass, it deviates from its path. The change in path is due to the change in speed of light.
                
                Why is the refraction of light happens?
                When  the ray of light enters into a denser medium it's a speed decreases,  light takes more time to travel same distance compare to the first  medium. To minimize the distance traveled in denser medium light bends  towards the normal. If the ray of light enters into a rarer medium  compared to the first medium, it's speed increases, light can cover more  distance easily in rarer medium so it bends away from the normal.
                We can summarize this in two lines.
                When a Ray of light enters in a denser medium it bends towards the normal.
                When a Ray of light enters in a rarer medium it bends away from the normal.</p>

                <h2>What is angle of incidence and angle of refraction? </h2>
                <P>

                    The angle between incident  ray and normal is called angle of incidence and the angle between  refracted ray and normal is called angle of refraction. The image angle  of incidence is in air and angle of refraction is in glass.
                    
                    If second medium is denser, angle of refraction will be smaller than the angle of incidence and vice-versa.
                    The image above shows small angle of refraction as glass is optically denser than air.
                    </P>
                   <h2> Laws of refraction</h2>
                    <p>
                    There are two laws of refraction. First law of  refraction is similar to second law of reflection and second law of  refraction is known as Snell's law.
                    
                    i) According to first law of refraction, " incident ray, refracted ray and normal lie in same plane".
                    ii) According to second law of refraction, " the ratio of sine of angle of incidence ( simply Sin i) to the sine of angle of refraction (simply Sin r) is equal to refractive index of medium" in which light enters.
                    As the refractive index of one medium remains  same so second law of refraction can also be states as, "the ratio of  sine of angle of incidence ( simply Sin i) to the sine of angle of refraction (simply Sin r) is constant."
                    sin i/ sin r = n
                    Where n is refractive index of medium
                    </P>

                    <h2>What is refractive index of medium?</h2>
                    <p>

                        Refractive index is the  measure of optical density of one medium with respect to other medium.  The change in speed of light depends on the optical density of medium in  which its entering. If the density of medium is high, speed decreases  and angle of refraction becomes  smaller. It means higher density  ratio  between second and first medium leads to greater change in speed of  light and smaller the angle of refraction. Similarly, If the density of  medium, in which light is entering, is low, speed increase and angle of  refraction becomes  larger. It means low density  ratio between second  and first medium leads to increase in speed of light and greater angle  of refraction.
                        
                        Refractive index formula
                        Refractive index is ratio  of speed of light in first medium to speed of light in second medium.  Let speed of light in medium one is v1 and in medium 2 is v2, and refractive index is n
                        
                        Refractive index   n= v<sub>1</sub>/ v2
                        
                        Here medium 1 can be anything, like water, air, glass etc.
                        
                        What is absolute refractive index
                        
                        If medium 1 is vacuum then the refractive index of second medium is called absolute refractive index.
                        Absolute refractive index   n= c/ v
                        Here c = speed of light in vacuum and v is speed in second medium.
                        
                        Refractive index of vacuum is 1
                        Refractive index of air is 1.0003
                        Refractive index of water is 1.33
                        Refractive index of glass is 1.5

                                    </p>

                    Distance and Displacement Questions
                     1. A, B, C and D are four cities. The distance between A and B is 45 km, between B and C is 63 km and from
                      C to D is 103 km. A car is traveling form city A to B, B to C, then C to D as shown in the video below. 
                     Calculate distance covered by the car between city A and D and the displacement of car between cities A and C.
                     $\vec{F} = \frac{d \vec{p}}{dt} = m \frac{d \vec{v}}{dt} = m \vec{a}$
