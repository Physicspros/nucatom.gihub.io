            <h1>Astrophysics</h1>
            <p>
                Astrophysics is the brach of physics which studies the universe. We explore many questions in Astrophysics
                such as: How the universe was formed? Why we are only on this planet? Is there life beyond earth? and so on. The list is
                never ending so the human curiosity. He keep generating questions and continuing exploring them, this is what has kept us 
                alive and evolve. 
                    There are some very common questions kids ask to thier elders:
                        <strong> How does the universe work?</strong> 
                        <strong> Are we alone here in this universe?</strong> 
                        <strong> Can we reach to other star?</strong> 
                        <strong> And obiviously</strong> will be living on mars after 10 or 20 years.
            </p>
            <h2>Stars</h2>
            ​<p> Stars are the most common objects seen in the night sky. They form the basic buiding block of galaxy.
                The study of age, brighteness, composition of a star may give lot of information about galaxy. 

                A big giant start is formed by the tiny particles of dist and gas. The gas and dust particles flaoting in 
                free space between galaxies start gravitating towards each other, very much similar to dust particles settling 
                on your laptop and computer screen. The increase in the size of gas the dust depostion increase its gravitational force
