            <h1>Energy and Energy Changes</h1>
            <h2>What is energy? and it's types:</h2>
            ​<p>What is Energy and it's unit?

                Energy is basic thing for humans to work, live, play. Without energy we can not walk, work or live. When a part of energy is released from our body we get tired walking, reading, standing etc becomes deficult at that time.  We can see that energy is important part of our life. Sun is the biggest source of energy available to Earth. Plant use sun to make their food using photosynthesis. All the eco system depends directly or indirectly on the plants for their food.  There are many forms of enrgy, fire, food, chemicals, light etc are sources of energy. Now the question is how to define energy? 

                Energy can be defined as an object’s capacity to do work. The more the energy of the object higher is its capacity to do work. The unit of energy is the same as that of work, Joule ( J ).
                </p>

                <h2>What is Kinetic Energy?
                </h2>
                <P>
                    Kinetic means resulting from motion. Kinetic is derived form the Greek word Kinein. In Hindi its called गतिज (gatij). Now, you may have guessed Kinetic energy of a body is energy due to motion. Kinetic energy can be defined as the energy possessed by the object by virtue of it's  motion.
                    For a body of constant mass  kinetic energy changes with change in velocity. Practically it is found that if mass 'm' of body is constant then  kinetic energy is directly proportional to square of velocity (v).
                    If velocity is constant and mass is changing then Kinetic energy is directly proportional to mass 'm' of the body.
                    </P>

                    <h2>Examples of kinetic energy</h2>
                    <p>
                        You can find many examples of kinetic energy around you.
                        1. a moving Bus has Kinetic energy.
                        2. A moving Car has kinetic energy.
                        3. A flying plane has a kinetic energy.
                        4. While walking or running we have kinetic energy.
                        5. A Bullet fired from Gun has kinetic energy.
                        </p>
                         <h2>What is Potential Energy? </h2>
                            <p>

                                Potential energy can be defined as the stored energy possessed by a stationary object. The potential energy of an object changes into kinetic energy as soon as the object is in motion. We know, that gravity pulls us all down to earth and it plays a huge role in the potential energy of objects at a vertical height.

                                The work done to move  an object of mass ‘ m ‘ to a height ‘ h ‘ is equal to W= m x g x h
                                Here, the potential energy possessed by the object is equal to the work done on it.

                                 </p>
                                 <img src="/science/energy/potential energy of object.jpg" alt="">
                                 <h2>Examples of potential energy</h2>
                                 <p>
                                    Similar to kinetic energy you can find many examples of Potential energy around you.

                                    1. As you can see in the image, the stone kept at height h has potential energy.
                                    2. A laptop kept on the table has potential energy.
                                    3. A flying plane has a kinetic energy as well as potential energy because its at some height form the ground.
                                    4. When we jump, we gain potential energy.
                                    5. The water filled in tank on the roof has potential energy.

                                    </p>
                                  <h2>  What is law of conservation of energy?</h2>
                                    <p>
                                    The law of conservation of energy states that one form of energy can be converted into another form of energy, yet the total energy before and after the conversion remains the same. This law is valid for all forms of energy.
                                    The sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy always remains constant.
                                    mgh + ½ mv2 = constant
                                    Note- The sum of the potential and kinetic energy of an object is equal to its total mechanical energy.
                                    </p>
