            <h1>NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION</h1>
            <h2>Newton's first law of motion:</h2>
            ​<p>Newton's first law of motion is also called as law of inertia. Inertia represent the state of a body or an object. The meaning of inertia in Oxford dictionary is " a tendency to do nothing or to remain unchanged". The law of inertia talks about the tendency of bodies to do nothing to change their present state. It means whatever the body is doing at present, in absence of all the external forces,  will continue to do the same forever. Law of inertia is universal and applicable to all the bodies.
                
                <i> In a fun way => it is applicable on us also. Let's take an example, if we are playing, we want to play forever until and unless we don't get tired or someone calls us to do other work. Hunger, thirst, responsibility force use to stop doing what we may be doing. Someone calling us to do the work is applying an external force in the form of order or request or reminding us of our duty.</i> <br> <br>
                
                Accroding to first law of motion, "all the bodies try to remain in their initial state until and unless an external force acts on them." So, if a body is addressed it will be rest and if a body is in motion it will be in motion until an external force acts on it.<br> <br>
                
                <strong>Examples of Newton's I law:</strong> 
                <img src="/science/newtons-laws-of-motion/Example of Newton's first law.jpg" alt="Example of Newton's I law">
            
                The ball kept on the table be a stay on the table forever if no force acts on it. <br>
                Glass kept in the kitchen will always stay in the kitchen until an unless someone comes and disturbs their position. <br>
                If a car is moving in absence of friction then it will continue to move unless some external force acts in opposite direction of it's motion.
                
                </p>

                <h2>Newton's Second Law of Motion:</h2>
                <P>According to Newton's second law, "the rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the applied and balance force." <br>

                    <img src="/science/newtons-laws-of-motion/Derivation of newton's second law.jpg" alt="Formula of newton's II law">

                   <strong>For example:</strong>  <br>
                    when a cricketer catches the ball, to increase the impact time he pulls his hand backward. This decreases the force applied by the ball on his hands. <br>
                    To make the landing smooth we jump on the cushion.
                    </P>

                    <h2>Newton's Third Law of Motion</h2>
                    <p>

                        According to Newton's third law, " for every action there is always equal and opposite reaction." <br> <br>
                        <strong>For example:</strong> 
                        If a person hit the wall,  the wall also applies the reaction force and person gets furt. <br>
                        To move forward we apply  backward force on the earth in turn earth also  applies creation force and we move forward. If we try to move on the sand then it's not easy to move on sand because our legs go down into the sand and the reaction force applied by the sand is smaller.
                        So when the action is less reaction will be less and when action is greater reaction will also be greater.  These are very much laws of nature. 
                        </p>
