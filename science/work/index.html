            <h1>Work</h1>
            <h2>What is work in Physics?</h2>
            ​<p>

            In  everyday situation reading, singing, jumping, holding weight, etc are  called work but in mechanical physics work is measured using 'force' and  'displacement'. If any of these two are absent then work done is zero. So you may wonder, reading is not work? Yes it is, but not in mechanics. Reading writing, office work, etc are work but they are measured in different way. <br>
            
            <strong>Mechanical Work in Physics:</strong> <br>
            Work  is defined as the product of the force ' F ' applied to move or  displace an object through a displacement 's ' in the direction of the  applied force. <br><br>
        </p>
            <p class="p1">
            If, the work done is denoted as  ‘W’ <br><br>
            
            W= F x s <br><br>

            
            In simple words we can explain: <i> work as the product of force and displacement.</i>

            Work is a scalar quantity. It means its represented by only magnitude and no direction.
            
            The unit of work done is Joule (J)  or newton-metre ‘N m’.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>What is one joule of work? </strong></p>
        <p>
            When you apply 1 N  of constant force on to displace the block for 1 m then the work done by you is 1J. <br> </p>
            
          <p class="p1">  1 J = 1 N-m </p>
    

        <h2>Types of work</h2>
        <p>
        <strong> Negative work done:</strong> <br>
        If the force applied is in opposite direction to the displacement of the object, then work done is said to be negative. </br>
        
        There are many examples of negative work done (and its not that negative but useful)
        </br> <br>
        <strong> Brake:</strong> To stop the car brake is aplied. The braked produces strong friction between tyre and road. The frictional  force is in opposite direction of displacement. it moves the friction acts backword to stop the car. But car does not stop immediately after the force is applied. In this case both are oppsite. <br> <br>
        <strong>Positive work done:</strong> <br>
        If the force on an object is applied in the same direction of displacement, the work done is said to be positive. <br>
        
         Work done by Engine: To increase the speed of car engine applies force in forward direction.  The engine produces strong force to accelerate the car forward. The force applied by engine and direction of displacement are same.  Work done is positive.

                <strong>  Question 1: </strong>

                A constant force of 30N is pushing a mass of 20 kg kept on the table. The displacement of the the mass is 50m. Calculate the work done.
            </p>
        <p>        <strong> Answer:-->> </strong>       
            
            <p class="p1"> Force = 30 N <br>
                         Displacement =50m <br> <br>
                
                Fomula:        Work  = Force x dispalcement <br>
                w = 30 x 50 <br>
                w= 150 J <br>
            </p>   
        <p>   
                Practice Question 2
                </p>
                <p>
                A constant force of 30N is pushing a mass of 20 kg kept on the table. The work done by mass is 300J. Calculate the displacement of object.</p>
                <p>
                
                Answer:-->>        Force = 30 N
            </p>
                Work done =300J
            </p>
            <p>
                         Displacement = Unknown
            </p>
                
        <p> 
                Fomula:        Work  = Force x dispalcement</p>
            <p>300 = 30 x Dispalcement</p>
        <p> Displacement = 300/30   = 10m</p>
            <p>   
                Practice Question 2
            </p>
            <p>
                A farmer is pushing a trolley of 50 kg  for 1 km with an acceleration of 2m/s^2.  Calculate the work done by farmer.</p>
            <p>
                Answer:-->>        Force = Unknown</p>
            <p>
                First calculate force applied by farmer.</p>
            <p>
                Mass = 50 Kg</p>
            <p> Acceleration = 2 m/s<sup>2</sup>  </p>
                <p>
                
                Force = mass x acceleration</p>
            <p>  F= 50 x 2 =100 N</p>
                
        <p>
                Fomula:        Work  = Force x dispalcement</p>
            <p>Work = 100 x 1000</p>
        <p> Work done = 100,000 J</p>
