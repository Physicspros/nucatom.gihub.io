            <h1>Balanced and Unbalanced Forces</h1>
            <h2>What is force?</h2>
            ​<p>Have you ever wondered what causes the stationary truck to move? Why do all the planets revolve
                around sun? Why does an object start movie? Why does the speed of object change with time? 
                Why do all the planets revolve around the sun?
                The answer of These question is Force. 
                As you may have already learned force is any push or pull which tries to change the shape, 
                size, state of the object. Force can bring a stationary object at rest and an object at 
                rest in motion. 
                Sometimes forces may be acting a body but it's effect may zero.  let us understand the 
                balanced and unbalacned forces
                Let's first understand about the balanced and unbalanced forces.</p>
               <h2>What are the balanced forces?</h2>
                <p>When two equal and opposite forces act on the same object at one point, their net effect 
                is zero this is called as balance force. <br> For example the forces acting on the car will 
                cancel each other so there effect will be zero. <p>

                <p class="p1">
                Fnet = F<sub>1</sub> - F<sub>2</sub>  <br> or <br> Fnet = F<sub>2</sub> - F<sub>1</sub>
                </p>
                <img src="/science/forces/Balanced forces.jpg" alt="Balanced forces">
                <h2>What is unbalanced  force?</h2>
                <P>When the sum of two or more forces acting on the object is not zero, then the forces are called as unbalanced forces. <br>
                    
                    For example the forces acting on the ball will not
                     cancel each other so the net force acting on the ball will not be zero.  
                                      </P>

                    <h2>What is net force? </h2>
                    <p>In tug-of-war force acts on the rope at both the ends but the rope does not move in any direction, though same
                         rope can be easily pulled by any of us. So, where is the all force going which is acting on the rope? To answer
                          the question you can see the direction of force at both the ends. The two teas they are applying force 
                          opposite to each other. If the forces are equal and opposite they cancel each other. Rope moves in the 
                          direction of team which applies more force. The difference of opposite forces is called net force. 
                            When forces are in same direction, net force can be found by adding two or more  forces acting on the object. </p>

                <h2>Distance and Displacement Questions</h2> <br>
                <h4>  Question1: Two forces of 5 Kg from left and 20 kg from right are acting on  an stationary 
                    object. Calculte the net force on the object.</h4>

                <p> <strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
               <p class="p1"> As given in the question, two forces are oppsite to each other.
                If 5N is positive the 20N would be negaitve. <br>
                
                Fnet  = 5 - 20  = - 15 N. <br>
                
                Here negative sign in the answer shows that 15N force is opposite to 5N force.</p>
            
                <h4> Question 2: The engine of car supplies force of 300N in forward direction on the car and
                     friction between the typre and road is 50N in backward direction. Calculate the
                      net force acting on the car.</h4>
                
                <p> <strong>Answer:</strong> </p>

                <p class="p1">
                   Two forces given in the question, <strong> friction </strong> and <strong>force by engine</strong>, are <strong>oppsite</strong> to each other. <br> <br>
                If 300N is positive the 50N would be negaitve. <br> <br>
                
                F<sub>net</sub>  = 300 - 50  = 250 N. <br> <br>
                
                In the answer we do not see the negative sign. It means net force is in direction of bigger force which is 300N force. </p>
                
                
               <h4> Question 3: Two forces of 15N  and 20N from right are acting on  an stationary object.
                    Calculte the net force on the object.</h4>
                    <p> <strong>Answer:</strong> </p>

               <p class="p1"> As given in the question, two forces are acting in same direction.

                Both 15N and 20N are positive. <br> <br>
                
                F<sub>net</sub>  = 15 + 20  = 35 N.</p>
