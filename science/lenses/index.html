            <h1>LENS AND TYPES OF LENS</h1>
            <img src="/science" alt="" srcset="">
            <h2>What is a lens? </h2>
            ​<p>Optical  devices such as the camera of mobile, DSLR, human eye- have lenses. The  lens is made of transparent materials and the lens refracts the  incident light. Depending on the type of lens, the rays can converge or  diverge from the lens. In this unit, we will learn about only two types  of lenses:
                convex lens and concave lens.
                What is the lens?
                A transparent material bound by at least one curved surface is called the lens.
                Convex and concave both the lenses have two curved surfaces.</p>

                <h2>Focus point and focal length of Convex lens</h2>
                <P>

                    The rays of light  travelling parallel to the principal axis of a convex lens, after  refraction,  converges towards the principal axis.
                    The point where the rays  meet is called a focus point. The distance between focus point and the  optical centre of a convex lens is called as its focal length.
                    
                    Note: In lenses, all the distances are measured from the optical centre of the lens
                    </P>

                    <h2>Focus point and focal length of a Concave lens</h2>
                    <p>

                        The rays of light  traveling parallel to the principal axis of a concave lens, after  refraction, diverge and appear to meet on the principal axis of the  lens. The point where rays meet is called a focus point.
                        The distance between focus point and the optical centre of a lens is its focal length. 
                        </p>

                <h3>Distance and Displacement Questions</h3>
                <p><strong>Question 1: </strong> Play video</p>
                <video controls src="/science/motion-images/Plane in motion.mp4"></video>
                <p>
                    <strong>Question 2:</strong>
                    Distance and Displacement Questions
                     1. A, B, C and D are four cities. The distance between A and B is 45 km, between B and C is 63 km and from
                      C to D is 103 km. A car is traveling form city A to B, B to C, then C to D as shown in the video below. 
                     Calculate distance covered by the car between city A and D and the displacement of car between cities A and C.
                     $\vec{F} = \frac{d \vec{p}}{dt} = m \frac{d \vec{v}}{dt} = m \vec{a}$
