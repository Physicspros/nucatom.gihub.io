            <h1>LENS AND TYPES OF LENS</h1>
            ​<p>Optical  devices such as the camera of mobile, DSLR, human eye- have lenses. The  lens is made of transparent materials and the lens refracts the  incident light. Depending on the type of lens, the rays can converge or  diverge from the lens. In this unit, we will learn about only two types  of lenses:
                convex lens and concave lens.
                <p>
                <h2>What is a lens? </h2>
                <p>
                A transparent material bound by at least one curved surface is called the lens.
                Convex and concave both the lenses have two curved surfaces.</p>
                <img src="/science/lenses/lens.JPG" alt="Concave and Convex lens">

                <h2>Important terms related to lens</h2>
                
                <h3>Principal Axis</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 2em;"> Principle axis of both the concave and convex lens is a line passing from the centere of lens. Principle axis joins both the focus points of lens. </p>
                <img src="/science/lenses/lens1.JPG" alt="Optical centre, Principal axis">
                <h3>Optical Centre</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 2em;">The optical centre of the lens lies between the two cruved surfaces on the principal axis of the lens.The is the middle part of lens. In the above diagram the white inside the lens is optical center. </p>
                <h3>Pole of lens</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 2em;">The point where principal axis enters and leaves the lens is called pole. Similar to poles of  mirrors the pole of lens lies on curved curfaces. </p> 

                <img src="/science/lenses/pole.jpg" alt="pole of concave and convex lens">
                 
                

                <h3>Focus point and focal length of Convex lens</h3>
                <P style="margin-left: 2em;">

                    The rays of light  travelling parallel to the principal axis of a convex lens, after  refraction,  converges towards the principal axis.
                    The point where the rays  meet is called a focus point. The distance between focus point and the  optical centre of a convex lens is called as its focal length.
                    
                    Note: In lenses, all the distances are measured from the optical centre of the lens
                    </P>

                    <h3>Focus point and focal length of a Concave lens</h3>
                    <p style="margin-left: 2em;">

                        The rays of light  traveling parallel to the principal axis of a concave lens, after  refraction, diverge and appear to meet on the principal axis of the  lens. The point where rays meet is called a focus point.
                        The distance between focus point and the optical centre of a lens is its focal length. 
                        </p>
